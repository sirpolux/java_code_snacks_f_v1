They allow you to organize related data efficiently and access it using an index. Arrays have a fixed size determined when they are declared, and each element in the array can be accessed by its position, or index, within the array. This makes arrays useful for tasks such as storing collections of data, iterating over elements, and performing operations on them in a systematic way.",
